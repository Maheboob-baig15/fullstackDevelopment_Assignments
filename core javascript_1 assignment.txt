1) Write a program that grades students based on their marks6
& If greater than 90 then A Gradp
& If between 70 and 90 then a B gradp
& If between 50 and 70 then a C gradp
& Below 50 then an F grade

function gradestudents(marks) {
    let grade;

    if (marks > 90) {
        grade = 'A';
    } else if (marks > 70 && marks <= 90) {
        grade = 'B';
    } else if (marks > 50 && marks <= 70) {
        grade = 'C';
    } else {
        grade = 'F';
    }

    return `The grade is ${grade}`;
}

const studentsMarks = 85;
console.log(gradestudents(studentsMarks));

2) Generate numbers between any 2 given numbers.
Ex.
Const num1 = 10;
Const num2 = 25;
Output: 11,12,13,......, 25


let num1 =10
let num2 =25


function generatenumberbetween(num1,num2){
    const number =[];

    for(i=num1 + 1; i<=num2; i++){
        number.push(i);

    }
    return number.join(',');     
}

console.log(generatenumberbetween(num1,num2))

3) Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print
“positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.

const number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number:"));

const result = number > 0 
    ? "positive" 
    : (number < 0 
        ? "negative" 
        : "zero");

console.log(`The number is ${result}.`);

4) Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.

The comma operator (,) in JavaScript evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand. It is often used to include multiple expressions in a place where only one expression is expected, such as in a for loop or as part of a return statement.

example:

 a) let x = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);
console.log(x);


 b) for (let i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i++, j--) {
    console.log(`i: ${i}, j: ${j}`);
}


 c) function doStuff() {
    return (console.log("First"), console.log("Second"), "Final Result");
}

console.log(doStuff());

 d) let a = 5, b = 10;
let max = (a > b, b);
console.log(max);

5) You're creating a basic login system. Make a login function with two things: a username and a
password. Check if the username is "admin" and the password is "12345". If they're both correct, show "Login
successful"; if not, show "Invalid credentials."

let username = "admin"
let password = "12345"

function login(username,password){
    if(username === "admin" && password === "12345"){
        console.log("login successful")
    } else{
        console.log("Invalid credentials")
    }
}

6) You are working on an e-commerce platform. Write a JavaScript program that takes the payment
method ("credit", "debit", or "paypal") as input and uses a switch statement to determine and print the
processing fee associated with each payment method. For example, "credit" may have a processing fee of
2%, "debit" 1.5%, and "paypal" 3%.

let paymentMethod = prompt("Enter the payment method (credit, debit, or paypal):");
getProcessingFee(paymentMethod);

function getProcessingFee(paymentMethod) {
    let fee;

   
    switch (paymentMethod.toLowerCase()) {
        case "credit":
            fee = "2%";
            break;
        case "debit":
            fee = "1.5%";
            break;
        case "paypal":
            fee = "3%";
            break;
        default:
            fee = "Invalid payment method";
    }

    console.log(`The processing fee for ${paymentMethod} is ${fee}.`);

7) You are building a weather application. Write a JavaScript program that takes the current temperature
as input and uses the conditional (ternary) operator to determine and print the weather condition. If the
temperature is above 30°C, the condition is "Hot"; otherwise, it is "Moderate".

let temperature = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the current temperature in °C:"));
getWeatherCondition(temperature);

function getWeatherCondition(temperature) {
    
    let condition = temperature > 30 ? "Hot" : "Moderate";
    console.log(`The weather condition is: ${condition}`);
}

8) You are creating a program to calculate the sum of numbers. Write a JavaScript program that takes a
positive integer as input and uses a do-while loop to calculate and print the sum of all numbers from 1 to the
given integer.

let positiveInteger = parseInt(prompt("Enter a positive integer:"));

if (positiveInteger > 0) {
    calculateSum(positiveInteger);
} else {
    console.log("Please enter a valid positive integer.");
}

function calculateSum(positiveInteger) {
    let sum = 0; 
    let i = 1;   

   
    do {
        sum += i; 
        i++;     
    } while (i <= positiveInteger);

    console.log(`The sum of numbers from 1 to ${positiveInteger} is: ${sum}`);
}
